# Spacey

An application that helps users learn more about outer space. Users can search for space related topics and find pictures, videos, and info related to their search.

## Motivation 

I have always been fascinated by space and the possibilties it presents to us, I also love getting sucked into a wikipedia rabbit hole. So I wanted to create something that would help users easily find and become absorbed in educational material about space.

## How to Use 

Spacey is extremely easy to use, just enter a term into the search bar and click search. Users who rely accessability features can easily search using their keyboard. cycle through the images by clicking previous and next buttons. Links to wikipedia are provided at the bottom of the reading section and links to youtube can be used by clicking on the titles of the videos.
